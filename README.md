I'm doing a simple rock paper scissors game to practice my fundamentals.
I saw this on The Odin Project.

#How to play
It's basically the same game we all played before.
You either select rock, paper or scissors. Computer does the same against you.
First player who reaches three points wins the game!
Good Luck!
